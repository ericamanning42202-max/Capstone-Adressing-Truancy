===============================

Instructions to publish this site on GitHub Pages:

1) Create a new GitHub repository
   - Go to https://github.com and sign in.
   - Click the + (top-right) -> New repository.
   - Repository name: capstone
   - Description: Addressing Truancy in South Carolina Schools â€” Erica D. Manning
   - Set repository to Public (or Private if you prefer).
   - DO NOT initialize with a README (optional).

2) Upload files
   - Download and unzip the package I provided in this assignment.
   - Drag and drop the files into your new repository (or use git push).
   - Commit the changes.

3) Enable GitHub Pages
   - In your repository, go to Settings -> Pages.
   - Under 'Build and deployment' choose 'Deploy from a branch'.
   - Under 'Branch' choose 'main' (or 'master' if your repo uses that).
   - Root folder: / (leave as default).
   - Click 'Save' or 'Deploy'; GitHub will publish the site shortly.

4) Access your live site
   - After a minute or two, your site will be available at:
     https://<your-github-username>.github.io/capstone
   - Example: https://ericadmanning.github.io/capstone

Notes:
- The form stores sign-ups in the user's browser (localStorage). To collect real submissions, connect the form to a backend or use Google Forms.
- If you want, I can generate a zip formatted for direct upload or provide the exact git commands to push the files from your computer.

Files included:
- index.html  (the complete website)
- README.txt  (this file)
